# Preparing Dietary Data
Polyphenol Estimator can work with:
 - ASA24 Recall or Records Items Files
 - NHANES "Individual Foods" Recall Files
    
ASA24 files can be pulled off the ASA24 Researcher Website and then run through Polyphenol Estimator. However, if you are working with NHANES AMPM data, you will need to prepare your data in a specific format. Read on for how you can pull down your ASA24 data and prepare NHANES data.
